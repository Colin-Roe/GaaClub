The app is built and managed on Azure Portal with continuous integration configured through Git and Azure DevOps Services. Code is published to a GitHub repository and constructs the application using Azure Pipelines. The pipeline enables continuous builds and deployments of the app. Any commit to the GitHub repository triggers a build and a deployment to the Azure Web App's staging slot.


I use Entity Framework as my object-relational mapping framework in ADO.NET.

Webpack is my module bundler.
